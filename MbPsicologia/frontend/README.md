# Technical Test for Junior Full Stack Developer Position

First, clone the backend repository:
[Link](https://github.com/Jonorusc/code-challenges/tree/desafio-joaolucas/MbPsicologia/backend)

## How I Implemented the Backend Project

I used Express to create the API, Prisma for the ORM, and MongoDB as the database for faster development. Indeed, it is a simple project (a CRUD) and does not require much complexity.

## How to Run the Project

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jonorusc/code-challenges.git
cd code-challenges/MbPsicologia
cd backend
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

OR

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment variables

Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API = "http://localhost:8080/mb/api/v1" # backend api url
```

## Run the application

```bash
yarn dev
```

## How i Implemented the Frontend Project

I used ReactJS to create the application, NextJS to facilitate the creation of routes, Styled Components to facilitate the styling of components, and Framer Motion to create satisfying animations.
